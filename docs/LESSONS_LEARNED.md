# Odoo tracking - Lessons Learned

## Iteration 2

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Implement robust error propagation in the Odoo tracking controller by wrapping external API requests in try-except blocks and raising informative `odoo.exceptions.UserError` messages to the UI, preventing silent backend failures from triggering the generic "Unknown issue" fallback.

### 2. Optimization: Implement explicit error handling in the tracking execution path to log stack traces and verify that `ir.model.access.csv` grants the UAT user full access to the tracking models.
