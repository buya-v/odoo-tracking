# Odoo tracking - Lessons Learned

## Iteration 4

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Implement robust error propagation in the Odoo tracking controller by wrapping external API requests in try-except blocks and raising informative `odoo.exceptions.UserError` messages to the UI, preventing silent backend failures from triggering the generic "Unknown issue" fallback.

### 2. Optimization: Implement explicit error handling in the tracking execution path to log stack traces and verify that `ir.model.access.csv` grants the UAT user full access to the tracking models.

### 3. Optimization: Increase the global end-to-end testing configuration's default `navigationTimeout` to 60,000ms and change the navigation wait strategy to `domcontentloaded` to prevent timeouts caused by Odoo's persistent background network polling.

### 4. Optimization: Bind the click event handlers for the Batch Operation list items to the details view logic, ensuring that interacting with specific entries (e.g., "batch/2023/003donewh/out8 ops") successfully triggers the expected modal or content expansion state.
